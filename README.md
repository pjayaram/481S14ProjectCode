=================
This project is designed to track user interaction with a 3d, immersive environment, and report these user 
analytics as a single file in the working directory. 

Python script is developed using Vizard 5.3 (32-bit) and associated libraries.

Ideal use is with an Occulus Rift and Xbox controller, but can be implemented with only a computer.
